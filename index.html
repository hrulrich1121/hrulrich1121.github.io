        <p>
            I am in this class to better understand how media, technology, and digital tools
            shape communication and content consumption. As a computer science student, I am
            interested in how technical systems intersect with media and everyday use.

            This section will list different types of media,
            subdivided into categories and examples.
            Content to be added later.

        <h2>Challenges with Media Tools and Technology</h2>
        <p>
            One challenge I experience with media tools is managing distraction and efficiency.
            With multiple platforms and devices competing for attention, it can be difficult to
            balance productivity with content consumption, especially when tools are designed
            to maximize engagement rather than focus.
